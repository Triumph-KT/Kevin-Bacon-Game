Java-based social network analysis tool to calculate actor separation using BFS.

## Overview
An interactive Java-based social network analysis tool that computes actor separation degrees using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Processes a large dataset (~9,235 actors, ~32,337 edges) to calculate shortest paths efficiently.

## Technologies
- Java
- Graph Algorithms (BFS)
- Network Analysis
- UI/UX Design

## Features
- Dynamic calculation of shortest paths.
- Optimized traversal with query response under 1 second.
- Graph-based UI for real-time exploration of actor networks.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
